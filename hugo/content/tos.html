    <h1>Open Collaboration Tools Website Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>21 June 2024</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the public Open Collaboration Tools service (the
        “Service”), provided by <a href="https://www.typefox.io/">TypeFox GmbH</a>
        (“TypeFox”). By accessing, browsing, or using this Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understand,
        and agree to be bound by these Terms. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the individual accessing the
        Service, as well as any entity on whose behalf such individual is acting.</p>
    <p>TypeFox offers the Service free of charge, on a voluntary basis, with the intent to demonstrate the
        capabilities of the Open Collaboration Tools project and to enable others to evaluate this open source
        software. Furthermore, TypeFox wants to support open source communities with this Service, enabling live
        collaboration in scenarios where code confidentiality is not an issue.</p>
    <p>TypeFox reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Service or these Terms at any time without
        notice. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new
        Terms.</p>
    <h2 id="1-description-of-the-service">
        1. Description of the Service
    </h2>
    <p>The Service is designed to facilitate live collaboration scenarios, allowing users to share IDE and editor
        contents with others in real-time. Users can start a collaboration session as a host and invite other
        participants. During a collaboration session, participants can see the host’s workspace, including text
        selections and cursor positions, and apply changes.</p>
    <p>The Service is intended solely for live collaboration scenarios as described above. Any use of the Service
        outside of these intended scenarios, including but not limited to unauthorized access to collaboration
        sessions, extraction of information without consent, manipulation of information without consent, or any
        other misuse, is strictly prohibited.</p>
    <p>Shared Content in the context of the Service means the content of the host’s IDE workspace or a single editor
        content, depending on how the host has initiated the collaboration session.</p>
    <h2 id="2-restrictions-on-use">
        2. Restrictions on Use
    </h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Service in any way that violates these Terms or any applicable law or regulation.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to collaboration sessions or other users’ data.</li>
        <li>Extract, collect, or store personal data or sensitive information from collaboration sessions without
            explicit permission from the respective participants.</li>
        <li>Engage in any activity that disrupts or interferes with the Service or its operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="3-confidentiality-and-content-sharing">
        3. Confidentiality and Content Sharing
    </h2>
    <p>By using the Service, you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any Shared Content within a collaboration session is visible to all invited participants.</li>
        <li>TypeFox is not responsible for the confidentiality or security of the content shared by users during
            collaboration sessions.</li>
        <li>Users concerned with confidentiality should consider deploying a private instance of the Service rather
            than using the public instance.</li>
        <li>Invited participants may modify the Shared Content; such modifications might persist after the
            collaboration session is closed.</li>
        <li>It is strongly recommended to review all changes resulting from a collaboration session before
            executing, deploying, or making use of them in any other way.</li>
    </ul>
